# **Encrypted Text Editor**

## *Goals for the Project*

The goal of this project is to create a functioning text editor that encrypts and decrypts a text file when it is created and saved. To achieve this goal, we need two separate components - the first is to create a text editor that can create, edit and save text documents. The second part of this project will implement an encryption system that will encrypt all text files the editor creates, edits and saves. The lower bound of this project will be the creation of the text editor, and the completion of it's functionalities. If this is met and we have the capacity to go further, we will implement a system whee the text within the file is automatically encrypted when it is saved so that no other text editor other than this one can open it.

## *Learning Goals from the Project*

The learning goals of this project is to understand how C works in a broader spectrum, as well as being able to learn more about how C works with encryption and decryption. Working on this project with a structured C with header files and clean code will allow us to work on projects and code in a more structured and balanced manner. Also, working on cryptography will open up a new realm of learning for us as we do not know a lot about this topic. We know the very basics of cryptography and its diverse methods, so we would like to focus on learning more about it and its implementation in C.

## *Resources*

We need to find resources that will let us understand cryptography and its implementation in C. Also, we need to know how to create a text editor in C, so string management in a terminal setting would be a good resource to have, as well as file management.

## *Steps to take*

The first step for our project is to find more resources of creating text editor with multiple features, and encrypting/decrypting messages. Both of us will work on this task, and we will share the links of the resources that we found and how we can use this resources in the update file. We should also decide what method we will going to use to encrypt the messages. There are various ways to encrypt the message, and we have to decide how complicated the encryption will be. We will have a concrete method of encryption when we are done with this task. Another task we have to work on is figuring out how we can save and bring the text file from what we write in the terminal. We will write the starting code to save the text written in the terminal to a file based on what we learn from this task.
